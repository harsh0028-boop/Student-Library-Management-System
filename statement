Manual library record-keeping is error-prone and time-consuming due to torn pages, illegible handwriting, and manual fine calculations, which often cause mistakes or favoritism.

The system is a console-based Python application built using Object-Oriented Programming and dictionaries for fast lookup and management.

It maintains a detailed book inventory that tracks the exact quantity of each book, automatically updating when books are issued or returned.

Before issuing a book, it checks if the book exists in the catalog and if copies are currently available.

The system prevents duplicate issuance by ensuring one user cannot borrow multiple copies of the same book simultaneously

It records the exact issue date and time to automate fine calculation: a Rs 50 fine is applied if a book is returned more than 7 days late.

Librarians use the system for hassle-free issuing, stock management, and fine collection.

School administrators get clear oversight of collection efficiency and fair fine enforcement.

Students benefit from transparent rules about book lending and returns without manual errors.

The current prototype stores data only in memory (RAM) while running, making it ideal for demonstrations or small setups.

The system design allows future enhancements with permanent storage using SQL databases or file handling.
